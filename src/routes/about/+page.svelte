	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>
		Hi, my name is Vince, as you probably read already on the navbar. I'm a student who likes to pretend to be a software engineer. I'm currently studying at BMSZC Petrik Lajos
		Két Tanítási Nyelvű Technikuma in Budapest.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm interested in everything that beeps and boops, but most of my experience is in Python
		scripting, web development and networking. I'm also a big fan of Linux and open-source software.
		I've been running Arch Linux on my laptop since 2020, and Proxmox on my server(s) since 2021.
	</p>
  <p>
    I also have some experience in media production, as I've been doing photography and sound stage work for a few years now.
  </p>
	<p>
		In my time away from computers, I enjoy photography, urban exploration, spending time with my amazing <span class="text-purple-300">girlfriend &lt;3</span>, and watching "educational" YouTube videos.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want to contact me, you can do so via email at <a href="mailto:vince@tvk.lol"
			>vince@tvk.lol</a
		>. Be advised that I barely check my email, so it might take a while for me to respond. If you
		want faster replies or just want to chat, you can find me on Discord at nemvince.
